# Project Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview

_This Anomaly Detection Project is designed to process and analyze data provided by users to identify and report
anomalies. By leveraging sophisticated machine learning models, along with comprehensive preprocessing methods and
various other ML techniques, the project aims to unearth patterns and outliers that deviate from the norm. The insights
gained through this analysis are presented to users via intuitive graphs, charts, and tables, enabling easy
interpretation and understanding of the detected anomalies._
## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Accepts user data in multiple formats, facilitating a smooth start to the anomaly detection
  process.
- **Preprocessing**: Implements a series of data cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare the data for
  analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML models specifically tuned for anomaly detection, ensuring
  high accuracy and reliability.
- **Visualization**: Offers a suite of visualization tools, including graphs, charts, and tables, to represent anomalies
  clearly and effectively.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: An easy-to-use dashboard that allows users to explore the analysis results and gain
  detailed insights into the detected anomalies.
- **Export Capabilities**: Enables users to export the results and visualizations for further analysis or reporting.
